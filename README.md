# UniLasso: Univariate-Guided Sparse Regression

UniLasso is a Python package that implements a novel and interpretable approach to sparse regression corresponding to **Univariate-Guided Sparse Regression** (https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/3i97j340/release/4).


## Features

- Implements UniLasso algorithm for various regression types (Gaussian, Binomial, Cox)
- Supports cross-validation for optimal regularization parameter selection
- Provides both fit and predict functionalities
- Includes utilities for data simulation


## Installation

You can install UniLasso by running the following script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sophial05/uni-lasso.git
cd uni-lasso
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use UniLasso:
```python
import numpy as np
from unilasso import *

# Generate some example data
X, y = simulate_gaussian_data(n = 100, p = 5)

# Fit UniLasso model using default lambda path
result = fit_unilasso(X, y, family='gaussian', lmdas = None)
plot_coef_path(result)

# Run UniLasso model using CV and plot CV error curve
cv_fit = cv_unilasso(X, y, family='gaussian')
plot_cv(cv_fit)
# extract the best cv model to use for prediction
extracted_fit = extract_cv(cv_fit)

# Generate some test data
X_test, y_test = simulate_gaussian_data(n = 100, p = 5)
# predict on test data
y_pred = predict(extracted_fit, X_test)

# Print coefficients
print("UniLasso coefficients:")
print(extracted_fit.coefs)
```

By default the second stage uses leave-one-out univariate fits as features, as in the paper.
With `loo=False` (in `fit_unilasso` and `cv_unilasso`) it uses the univariate fits themselves.
UniLasso is then exactly the lasso with penalty factors $1/|\hat\beta_j|$ and the constraints
$\mathrm{sign}(\beta_j) \in \{0, \mathrm{sign}(\hat\beta_j)\}$, where $\hat\beta_j$ are the
univariate slopes. This matches `uniLasso(loo = FALSE)` in the R package.

```python
result = fit_unilasso(X, y, family='gaussian', lmdas=0.01, loo=False)
```
