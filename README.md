# UniLasso: Univariate-Guided Sparse Regression

UniLasso is a Python package that implements a novel and interpretable approach to sparse regression corresponding to **Univariate-Guided Sparse Regression** (https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/3i97j340/release/4).


## Features

- Implements UniLasso algorithm for various regression types (Gaussian, Binomial, Cox)
- Supports cross-validation for optimal regularization parameter selection
- Provides both fit and predict functionalities
- Includes utilities for data simulation


## Installation

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install unilasso
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sophial05/uni-lasso.git
cd uni-lasso
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest
```

`unilasso` depends on [adelie](https://github.com/JamesYang007/adelie), which provides wheels
for Python 3.9 to 3.12. Optional extras: `color` (colored warnings, with `colorama`), `test`
(`pytest`) and `dev`.

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use UniLasso:
```python
import numpy as np
from unilasso import *

# Generate some example data
X, y = simulate_gaussian_data(n = 100, p = 5)

# Fit UniLasso model using default lambda path
result = fit_unilasso(X, y, family='gaussian', lmdas = None)
plot_coef_path(result)

# Run UniLasso model using CV and plot CV error curve
cv_fit = cv_unilasso(X, y, family='gaussian')
plot_cv(cv_fit)
# extract the best cv model to use for prediction
extracted_fit = extract_cv(cv_fit)

# Generate some test data
X_test, y_test = simulate_gaussian_data(n = 100, p = 5)
# predict on test data
y_pred = predict(extracted_fit, X_test)

# Print coefficients
print("UniLasso coefficients:")
print(extracted_fit.coefs)
```
